# Intuitive Hierarchical State Machine Programming

hsmp defines an Intuitive Notation Language for writing a UML Hierarchical State Machine program. By using this language, a hierarchical state machine is composed as a Grammar File. hsmp takes this grammar file and generates a high efficient hierarchical state machine in C or Python code.

The overall grammar of hsmp is very much yacc or Gnu Bison alike but simpler and intuitive, brings no hassle for any level of computer programmer to learn and use.

hsmp uses UML state machine as the standard definition of Hierarchical State Machine, it supports UML state machine version 2.0.

hsmp v1.0.3 can generate target state machine code in C or Python language based on command line option specified. Future releases may support to generate code in Java, C++ and other languages. Generating a hierarchical state machine diagram may be supported in future releases, too.
